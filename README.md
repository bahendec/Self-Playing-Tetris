## Self-Playing-Tetris
##### About:
This project is me trying my hand at developing a Tetris game and designing an algorithm for a computer player to use to get the highest score possible. Currently the score reaches ~ 2000 before failure.
##### In order to run the project:
- Clone the repo
- Install p5.js
- Host the project locally and run it using something such as the "Live Server" extension on VSCode
##### Potential Future Improvements:
- Optimize algorithm for computer player.
- Improve Tetris Game UI/UX
- Create tools to test different parameter weights to find the best values
